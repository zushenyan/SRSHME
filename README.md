# SRSHME
SRSHME - Simple Realtime Syntax Highlight Markdown Editor. Just a showcase of how realtime syntax highlight in HTML is possible.

# Browser Support
Tested on the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and IE 10+.

# Just an Reminder here...
Be aware of the code is not optimized. When you typed too many texts, 
it will become more and more laggy...because I choose to do it in a straight way,
and since it's just a showcase & tutorial, I will just leave it here if there are no more critical bugs.
